<h2>Comments</h2>
<!-- the @article comes from the controller but it is
a Article model passed in and we are calling comments on it.
gets the partial name by: apparently as it iterates over the @articles.comments,
it assigns each comment to a local variable named same as partial in tyhis case its comment.
that is why we named the partial: comments._comment.html.erb (i dont fully understand this) -->
<%= render @article.comments %>

<h2>Add a comment:</h2>
<!-- had to use comments/form because this is in the comments directory and we are in articles
also it has access to @article object because its in an instance variable -->

<%= render 'comments/form' %>

<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_article_path(@article) %> |
<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>
